## 🚀 Ad Slot Allocator System (Knapsack-Based Optimization)

This project implements an **Ad Slot Allocation System** that leverages the **0/1 Knapsack Algorithm** to maximize total advertising revenue by optimally selecting advertisement bids under time constraints.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given multiple advertisers, each with:

* **Bid Amount (Value)**
* **Ad Duration (Weight)**
* **Available Slot Capacity (Total Time Limit)**

The system selects the optimal combination of ads that maximizes total revenue without exceeding the available advertisement time.
