
## 🚀 Ad Slot Allocator System (Knapsack-Based Optimization)

This project implements an **Ad Slot Allocation System** that uses the **Knapsack Algorithm** to maximize total revenue by optimally selecting advertisement bids under time and slot constraints.

### 🔍 Problem Statement

Given multiple advertisers with:

* Bid Amount (Value)
* Ad Duration (Weight)
* Available Slot Capacity (Total Time)

The system applies the **0/1 Knapsack Algorithm** to select the optimal combination of ads that maximizes total revenue without exceeding available slot time.
